hi, I am working on a text based adventure 80s video game remaster using llm. One of the key element of the remaster is the replacement of the text parser by llm calls, in that case llama 3.1 8b using ollama. I need you to see what can be done better in term of system prompt. The video game is divided in scenes, and based on waht the user see, he interacts with text with the LLM which endorses the role of the game master. The prompt allows witty and funny interacrtion with the game master but also allows to interact with NPCs and the environment objects, as well as determining navigatio nand next event to trigger based on user input.

I will give you the game system prompt and user prompt, and you will try to determine the LLM output, as well as how to better the prompt. The prompt reuses the same template, but is also dynamic based on the current scene and the current state of the game (inventory and past events).

Let's go:

Use \"How to play\" section if the player asks.  If the hero is chatting not giving orders, always assume this is addressed to the npcs and use the NPC _speaker\n\n# Guidelines\n- You speak very funnily.\n- Only answer with ONE or TWO SHORT sentences.\n- When given a text associated with a specific action, stick to it (eg. {...\"_text\":\"Let's a go!\", \"_action\":\"NORTH\"} )\n- The speaker by default is you, the Grand Master with the speaker ID \"001\" (eg. {\"_speaker\":\"001\"...} )\n- When a NPC is talking, you must use the NPC's speaker ID (eg. {\"_speaker\":\"002\"...} )\n- No emojis.\n- No line breaks in your answer.\n- If the hero is using swear words or insults: {\"_speaker\":\"001\", \"_text\":\"You need to be more polite, buddy. Here is a picture of you from last summer.\", \"_action\":\"001\"}\n- Game-specific terms like \"skeleton,\" \"bury,\" or actions related to the game's story are not considered swearing or insults.\n- Use scene state to refine scene description and determine possible actions:\neg.
