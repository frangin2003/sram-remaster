 orange, and purple. A weathered wooden bridge extends gracefully across the calm waters, leading to a small, lush island crowned with trees.
 The reflection of the sun and vivid sky dances on the waterâ€™s surface, creating a mesmerizing tapestry of colors.
 The gentle ripples and scattered rocks in the shallow water add a touch of serenity, while the path across the bridge beckons with quiet mystery,
 promising discovery beyond the horizon.""",
