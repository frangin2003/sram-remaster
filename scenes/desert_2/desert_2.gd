 The rippling patterns of the sand stretch far into the horizon, untouched and desolate. 
 Nearby, a skeletal carcass lies half-buried in the sand, its bleached bones a grim reminder of the desert's unforgiving nature. 
 The air is still, save for the faint whisper of shifting grains carried by the scorching wind.
 The hero's mouth is parched, their steps heavy and faltering.

 Without water, they know they cannot continue furtherâ€”a desperate thirst claws at their resolve as the harsh desert seems to stretch 
 endlessly before them.""",
